1. CLI

This is a stream socket client program that is designed to connect to either
a TCP socket or a UNIX stream socket. It provides a pretty NCURSES style
interface to the user and contains useful features like an arbitarily wide
screen width that can be scrolled laterally, a scrollback feature where text
that has scrolled off the screen can be viewed by scrolling vertically, and a
logging feature that saves all sessions to a file and tabulates them by date
and time.

To make the program, you will need a version of GCC that supports c++23, and
you will need the NCurses development library. Install this (on a Debian
machine) by typing the following:

sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev

After making the program, invoke it by typing:

./cli

The program will attempt to connect to the socket you have configured. To
configure the program, edit the cli.ini file and make sure the following
categories and fields are present:

[client]

# select: none/tcp/unix
connection = tcp
ip = 127.0.0.1
port = 9734
unix_socket = manager.sock
scrollback = 1000
pad_width = 256
log = cli.log
history = 100
history_is_persistent = true
history_cache = cli.history

EXPLANATION OF CLI.INI FIELDS:

connection: choose none (program does nothing), tcp, or unix.

ip: If tcp is chosen, this is the IP address you wish to connect to.

port: if tcp is chosen for connection, this is the port to use.

unix_socket: if unix is chosen for connection, this is the UNIX socket
filename that you wish to connect to. Take note that if the UNIX socket file
is privileged, you may need to start ./cli with root privileges.

scrollback: length of scrollback in lines. Press F8 to enter scrollback and
F8 again to leave scrollback. While in scrollback, the arrow keys and page-up/
page-down control navigation through the scrollback.

pad_width: the width of the terminal does not determine how wide a line of text
will be. Setting pad_width will allow the screen to be as wide as desired. To
scroll through the pad, use the scrollback feature and use left and right 
arrow keys.

log: All sessions are logged to this file.

history: Keeps a history of the last commands entered on the command line.

history_is_persistent: Determines whether the program loads the history cache
file when started. Otherwise, the history buffer is fresh and empty for each
new session.

history_cache: The file that contains historic command line entries.

TESTING THE PROGRAM:

In another terminal window, invoke the Netcat program with the following
switches:

nc -l 0.0.0.0 9734

This will stand up an impromptu TCP listener on the selected port (9734 in this
case). While Netcat is running, go back to the window where you have built cli
and start up cli. Now anything you type in cli should show up in the Netcat
window and vice versa.
